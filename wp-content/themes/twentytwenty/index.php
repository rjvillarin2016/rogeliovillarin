				<p>We also convert minibuses to make them wheelchair accessible, which includes the installation of a tail lift and the Unwin low profile tracking flooring system. All tail lifts are subsequently tested and certified, and the vehicle is then tested and certified by VOSA. Finally, the vehicle is delivered to the customer.</p>
